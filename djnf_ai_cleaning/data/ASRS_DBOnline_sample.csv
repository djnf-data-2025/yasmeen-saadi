While on taxiway C; I heard ground clear another Skyhawk to taxi to the runway via taxiways E and A. I continued to taxi while looking for the other traffic. There is a downgrade on taxiway B that takes it below a hill between taxiways B and A as you near the intersection of B and A. Taxiway B clears that hill just before the intersection. After looking to my right towards taxiway A and seeing no one; I continued to taxi towards the intersection and looked left in the direction I was to turn. As I was turning onto taxiway A; I saw the other Skyhawk in my peripheral vision and hit the brakes to stop at the same time as the other pilot. Both planes were in the intersection stopped a few feet away from each other. The other pilot called Ground to advise of the near collision and the controller apologized stating that they had lost sight of us. I radioed the other pilot and asked if everyone was okay. After determining that no collision had occurred and there were no injuries; I agreed to continue my turn as I was in front of the other plane. We both continued to the runup area without incident and continued with our flights. While the terrain and darkness were contributing factors; I believe that the primary cause was a failure to approach a known hotspot with due caution. In the future I will pause as I approach this intersection and use an extra second to check for traffic before continuing.,,,,A General Aviation aircraft following taxi instructions from ATC had to suddenly brake to avoid another aircraft taxiing into the same intersection.,,

I was the Pilot Flying. When we lined up on the runway the data in my [display] did not look accurate. I elected to vacate the runway. We assessed the information and were re-cleared for take off with no further issue.,,Prior to pushing up the throttles up for takeoff; the Captain stated that their [display] was not correct. I told Tower we were going to taxi clear as there was an aircraft on final. We looked down and the Flight Director was not displaying guidance even though the switches were on and the FMS correctly loaded.At the gate we had some kind of electrical MEL (I can't recall what). Also the IRUs were not aligning like normal. We called Maintenance who sent contract BWI Maintenance who told us that the gates at BWI had a problem with acquiring the GPS signal (this was strange as the terminal was north of the plane so that the plane had a clear path towards the equator). We discussed and the Captain decided we would push into the alley to try and get a signal. Again that didn't work and we discussed with Maintenance on the ops frequency who told us the closer we got to the runway it would work. We decided to taxi towards the runway. On the taxi out GPS 2 acquired a signal; but was intermittent. We pulled into the de-ice area adjacent to Taxiway P by Runway 15R. Finally we got both GPS signals to acquire which was required for our RNAV route and Required RNP FMS message.If the BWI gates historically have problems with acquiring the GPS signal; then a note about that (and if associated the Flight Directors not providing guidance) should be added to the company pages in the Jeppesen FD Pro App. If the failure was associated with the MEL; then a note about it and the flight directors not providing guidance should be added to the associated MEL in the B737 NG Minimum Equipment List / Configuration Deviation List.,,B737 pilot crew reported the IRU's would not align; resulting in a rejected takeoff.,,BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON INTL

Captain decided to reject takeoff. It turns out the right Gen went out but also took a T.R with it. Bus ties were not working as they should. Ran DDG off the runway and taxied back to the gate. Mx had problems resetting the bus ties. Mx finally got everything everything straightened out and we left for ZZZ without further incident.,,Slightly above 80 kts we got some screens flickering; then load shedding; multiple EICAS messages; which included R Gen Off. Since it appeared worse than a Gen Off indication I elected to abort the takeoff at about 100 kts. We informed tower and cleared the runway at G taxiway. Stopped the aircraft upon clearing the runway to run checklists; evaluate the situation; and see how hot the brakes will get. Upon further inspection we also had a Transformer Rectifier Status message. I elected to run the R Gen Off QRH but that was unsuccessful especially since the status message. I told the First Officer to run his after takeoff flow. We then contacted our companies Dispatch via Satcom. Told them the situation and that we would do a block turn back to give the plane back to maintenance. Me and the First Officer monitored the brake temperatures as we seen a high of 8 on the btms. The brakes were already cooling off really good and we didn't anticipate any problems so we elected to slowly taxi back into the blocks. When the First Officer did a walk around he didn't notice any defects to the tires; or brakes; etc. Maintenance had to do an engine run up to disconnect the Electric drive as there appeared no way to get that generator back online. When they did that they got multiple load shedding and the Lower Eicas went blank. The Apu generator was operating so none of that should have been happening and it appeared to be a bus tie issue not closing properly. They did a couple engine run ups and eventually got the bus ties to work correctly; the Gen Drive to disconnect normally; and got the Transformer Rectifier Eicas to clear. We later operated the flight with 1 engine generator and the Apu on the whole flight per the DDG. No other issues noted.,,Flight Crew reported a rejected take off caused by electrical system failures.,,BWI - Baltimore

It may seem small; but one; this ESN Tower; regularly inappropriately advertise their approach as a non-existent approach. Their ATIS will advertise (and Potomac will sometimes also call it) as a 'GPS Runway 4' or other 'GPS' approach. In fact; ESN has no GPS approaches; only RNAV approaches. These are indeed listed as 'RNAV (GPS)'; however consulting both the AIM and ATC 7110.65 they clearly state that anything in parenthesis is not part of the approach name. A 'GPS' approach is entirely different from an 'RNAV' approach. In fact you see this by looking at the nearby W75 airport; which has an actual 'GPS' approach. How does this create a safety issue? Pilots are taught to find out the approach in use; they look up the IAP and brief it. Approaches are listed alphabetically in the books and in most FMS systems. When ATC tells you the approach in use is 'GPS Runway 4;' the pilot looks for exactly that; GPS Runway 4. An RNAV approach is not listed as GPS though; it's listed as RNAV; because it's an RNAV approach; not a GPS approach. The extra heads-down time required to figure this out; especially at unfamiliar airports; can cause an unnecessary safety risk; as the pilot has to spend more time diverting attention from flying and more time trying to ascertain what ATC means.This seems like a fairly simple thing that can be corrected simply with a memo to ATC reminding them that an approach listed as RNAV (GPS) is an RNAV approach; not a GPS approach; and should be referred to using the correct terms. Although I've encountered this issue at many airports; ESN is one of the worst offenders I've ever come across; as they rarely use the proper term. I shouldn't have to brief students that 'this tower does things wrong so expect this but do that'. ATC should perform their duties correctly.,,,,Pilot reported ESN Tower advertises a GPS approach when the airport has RNAV (GPS) approaches.  Pilot reported this makes it difficult to look up the approach.,,

BWI Ground Operations does not have an effective FOD Awareness Program. We sat at the gate for nearly 90 minutes preparing for our flight. During the delay while waiting 50 minutes for five bags from Flight #XXXX (which never arrived); the ramp personnel had plenty of time to pick up the FOD in and around the Safety Zone. Excessive FOD was present before; during; and after the push off BWI Gate XX. No effort was made to remove the FOD. BWI Ramp Personnel walked by; stepped on; and ignored FOD all over the flight line. As we were being pushed back I asked the Ramp Crew to pick up FOD (papers; gloves; concrete gravel stones; plastic strapping material; etc.) to avoid ingesting FOD in the engines while we were starting engines. Because of the confined space in the back alley; the lead aircraft is more likely to blow FOD into the engines of the second aircraft. We called BWI Ground Control to remove FOD from the area at the top of the back alley where FOD had accumulated in the vicinity of the electric light control building. Also; the concrete along the vehicle road adjacent to the black storm drain grating is breaking up between BWI Gates XY and XZ. Chunks of concrete; stones; and gravel litter the ramp in this vicinity. The ramp looks as if it has been breaking up for weeks; but nobody has made the effort to remove the concrete FOD until BWI airport can make repairs.The BWI Station Manager needs to take responsibility for the FOD Awareness Program.  At this time; there is no evidence that BWI has an effective FOD Awareness Program.  Leadership for an effective FOD Awareness Program starts from the top.  Leaders need to train all employees to participate in the FOD Awareness Program on a daily basis and enforce compliance with the program.  The BWI FOD Awareness Program exists; at best; as a 'lip service' program. Bringing this issue to the attention of leadership falls on deaf ears. My impression is that BWI leadership; to the highest leadership levels; does not care to address or fix this ongoing problem. We need to collectively protect our engines from unnecessary damage resulting from FOD. BWI Airport Operations needs to repair the concrete breaking up near the vehicle road adjacent to the black storm drain grating between BWI Gates XY and XZ. In the meantime; Company BWI Ground Operations needs to take responsibility for removing the concrete debris. I immediately notified BWI OPS by radio of the FOD hazard. I am not sure of what action has been taken to remedy the safety concern.,,,,Flight Crew taxiing aircraft encounter excessive Foreign Object Debris (FOD) in ramp area.,,Baltimore/Washington Intl

We were assigned to park at Gate X. On the current ATIS; it had a NOTAM that said 'Taxi F closed between Taxiway P and Taxiway T.' So we had an expectation bias to exit Runway 33L at Taxiway F and that our taxi-in instructions would be to taxi to Gate X via Taxiway P; E; and T. Partly contributing to this expectation was the fact that the last time I flew a month ago; there was also construction on Taxiway T between Taxiways H and F. We also had an additive condition which I briefed at the beginning of the trip that this was my first trip back to work after not flying for 30 days.However; after landing rollout and upon exiting Runway 33L at Taxiway F; we were given instructions by Tower to taxi to Gate X via 'Taxiway P; T to T; and contact Ground.' I thought the Controller had stuttered when he said 'T to T.' So I made the right turn from F to P; thinking he meant 'P; E; T.' We contacted Ground after making the right turn on to Taxiway P. Ground then told us we had turned the wrong way and should have been going the opposite direction on P; then T2; to T. We asked what Taxiway T2 is; since Taxiway T2 is not depicted anywhere on the 10-9 page. He said it is a new taxiway. I do not recall any NOTAMs saying there is a new Taxiway T2; nor where it is located. There was nothing on the ATIS about it.We did not cause any traffic conflicts and held at our current position so that outbound aircraft could taxi out. We were then cleared to our gate without any further incident.In the future; I will remember to stop the aircraft immediately and query ATC whenever there is any doubt or ambiguity in a taxi clearance. Also recommend that the BWI airport advise on their ATIS and their NOTAMs that there is a new Taxiway T2. Furthermore; I would recommend they use a different name for the new Taxiway; as the two different phrases 1) 'T to...' and 2) 'T2' can be easily misconstrued for each other in a verbal clearance.',,,,Air Carrier Captain reported a taxiway incursion and stated Taxiway T2 which was included in their clearance is not charted.,,Baltimore/Washington Intl

We contacted Ground Control before push and asked if we could expect Runway 10 instead of Runway 15R due to the flow pattern shown on 10-9E SMGCS Low Visibility chart. Taxiing to Runway 15R was against the directional flow pattern shown on Taxiway F. We explained our concern to the Ground Controller. This was not an option because their charts did not show Runway 10 for departure during low visibility operation from our position at the new Midfield Cargo Complex. Our charts show taxi available to Runway 10. We discussed this to our Dispatcher; Duty pilot and Ops. We requested a 'follow me' service provided by the airport to guide us safely though the low visibility to Runway 15R. [I suggest] a revision to BWI Ground control SMGCS (Surface Movement Guidance and Control System) Low Visibility taxi charts for departures to Runway 10 from Midfield Cargo Complex as shown on Jeppesen Low Visibility SMGCS chart 10-9E; [and also] change taxi flow direction for operation from Midfield Cargo to Runway 15R.,,During pre-departure briefing; we noticed that SMGCS (Surface Movement Guidance and Control System) Low Visibility taxi chart for Runway 10 and Runway 15R; from our current position; we could only use Runway 10 for departure.

BWI Ground responded that due to low visibility procedures in effect; Runway 10 was in use for arrivals and Runway 15R for departure and our taxi route would be [Taxiways] G; F; P to Runway 15R. I explained to him that according to the SMGCS chart we would be taxiing against flow on Taxiway F and we could taxi to Runway 10. Ground responded that he did not have charts for a low visibility taxi to Runway 10. We contacted Dispatch; Duty Pilot and Ops. We requested a 'follow me' to guide us to Runway 15R on the expected route and departed.[I recommend] BWI Ground update their SMGCS charts and establish a low visibility taxi route to go from Midfield Cargo to Runway 15R.,,Flight crew reported a low visibility taxi chart discrepancy.,,Baltimore Washington International

He had spent all of his time up to this point flying the Aircraft Y Type; so I was helping him familiarize himself with the different aircraft. We were doing pattern work while several other aircraft were in the pattern.  Upon getting abeam the numbers and beginning our descent; there was an aircraft on long final (roughly 2-2.5 miles) that we did not hear on the radio.  We continued with our base; and final. The CPL whom I was instructing did not speak very strong english; and was having some trouble with the radio calls in the pattern; and occasionally neglecting to make them. In this instance; he neglected to call his base; and also neglected to call final.  I noticed this only after him turning final without saying anything; and immediately announced our one mile final. This set up a situation where a near miss occurred between us and the other aircraft who was on long final. The aircraft that was on a long final did not call an extended downwind; or a base.  They called final and neglected to give any mileage to indicate they had flown a much larger pattern than usual for a light general aviation plane. The other aircraft noticed us only because I called our final; and immediately broke off his final leg to avoid collision.  I spoke with their pilot after this incident and he said we were slightly above them and cut them off. I believe this incident was caused by a number of factors mentioned above; and could have been avoided with better radio work on the part of my aircraft and the other one on final.  I had a high workload at the moment; which caused my attention to lapse when the CPL turned base without making the call.  However; the pilot on the other aircraft also did not specify that he was purposely flying a large pattern with an extended downwind/base/final.  His failure and mine to accurately give position reports caused the incident.   I also believe that often pilots become complacent and fly a pattern which is far too large at this airport.  There are several times in a week where I have to extend my pattern to a point where I would not be able to make the runway in the event of an engine failure.  Routinely; general aviation aircraft at the airport fly a 2+ mile final; which should be considered a 'long' final.  Like in the incident mentioned; this can cause confusion when someone joins flying a smaller; more appropriate pattern.,,,,Flight Instructor reported a NMAC of final resulted in Evasive action.,,

Here is the relevant data:- The airport in question is Montgomery County Airpark; in Gaithersburg; Maryland; GAI. It is a very busy *uncontrolled* airport. It is within the DC SFRA; so pilots must obtain a discrete transponder code from Potomac Approach before taking off; and before re-entering the SFRA from outside. - The airport's only runway is 32/14; about 4000 feet long. The airport ATIS specifies that Runway 14 is preferred in calm-wind conditions. Also; the only approach to GAI is an RNAV/LPV approach to Runway 14. - There is a very; very active primary-training type airport. Nearly all of its students are [from] overseas; and the frequency of their flight means that the traffic-pattern at the airport is usually 'full.' It is typical to have one plane doing a runup; another taking off; another on downwind turning to base; and two or three others approaching from the north; all at the same time.- On the morning of this incident; winds had been in the 5 kt range--but from the north. So traffic through the morning had been all on Runway 32. - Now; the time in question. It was about XA:00 local EST. I was approaching from the north; and I received a code for entering the SFRA from Potomac Approach. As is usual practice; when I was about 12 miles north of GAI; I told Potomac; 'Gaithersburg in sight;' and they gave the formulaic response: 'Stay on discrete transponder code until landing; remain outside Class Bravo; switch to local frequency approved.' So I switched to the local UNICOM; 123.075.-I heard on the frequency what I also saw on my ADS-B display: That the pattern was; as usual; 'busy;' with three or four planes at various points in the circuit. And all of them were using Runway 32. (The winds at that moment were reporting calm on ATIS; but the pattern had been in steady use all day; on 32.)-Over the next eight minutes or so; between first radio contact and landing; I noticed two recurrent phenomena. One was many planes reporting their progress and position in a pattern for Runway 32.  I made calls; beginning at 8 miles out; with intentions to follow the established local practice. ('Forty-five to join right downwind for Runway 32.') The other notable entry was one airplane (Airplane X) that reported it was to the west; and 'straight in landing; Runway 14.'-A plane reports 'downwind 32.' Aircraft X says; 'straight in; Runway 14.' Another plane says; 'Aircraft X; we are using 32; please circle to land.' Aircraft pilot says; 'Straight in Runway 14.' At least twice; and I think three times; flight instructors say 'Aircraft X; PLEASE circle to land 32. We are all using 32.' Aircraft X replies; 'Straight in; 14.'-I kept reporting my own position; and said at one point 'Aircraft X; I am turning base to final for landing 32.' At that point I could see him descending to 14 -- i.e.; head on. The distances were such that it was clear to me that I could land safely and normally; and get off the runway; before he got too close.   And I proceeded to land. I turned off the runway halfway down; while he was still probably a mile out on opposite-direction final. All the other planes in the Runway 32 pattern extended their downwind etc.; to land. -The two planes landed at XA:07 pm EST; but in opposite directions.-Later; I saw someone who I assumed to be the Aircraft X pilot. He was; and I asked him: 'Why did you do that?' His answer was that he was fine-tuning the coupled-autopilot and wanted to fly an approach all the way down. -Note: I have been in this situation myself too; wanting to check out autopilots. But I choose airports where I can do so in keeping with the local traffic flow. -The main problem in this scenario was the Aircraft X pilot; who insisted on plowing ahead despite repeated requests on the frequency to switch to join the busy local traffic flow. I realize this is not an 'enforcement' forum; and I mention it just FYI.-The larger point is that the Gaithersburg airport has become unsustainably busy; for its uncontrolled status.  I have landed there probably X times over the past XX years. I *always* view the most challenging part of any trip to be the final 10 minutes of trying to fit into the uncontrolled but increasingly busy traffic pattern there.  With many primary students in training; they're often doing unexpected things in the pattern; or are uncertain in radio calls. Suggestion / request: Sooner or later there is going to be some safety incident at this airport; coming from too much traffic with too little control. A tower controller would *never* have allowed the situation I'm reporting to emerge. This is a problem waiting to happen at this airport.,,,,GA pilot reported that while landing at an uncontrolled airport another aircraft landed on the same runway; opposite direction. Reporter stated the airport was always busy and should become a tower-controlled airport.,,

They did not verify the bypass handle had returned to the normal steering position.  Pushback was stopped early because tug began to slide on the ramp.  We disconnected within 10 feet of the normal engine start position.  After engine start as I attempted to taxi due to a very slippery ramp condition we immediately began to slide without nose wheel steering.  I stopped the aircraft and reported poor to nil braking on the ramp thinking the slide was caused by outside conditions.  We advised ATC we were holding our position.  Maintenance came out to the aircraft and after plugging in reported that the bypass lever had inadvertently been stuck in the bypass position after the pin was removed.  The aircraft had been on the ground for four to five hours in freezing precipitation.  We had deiced at the gate but I am unsure if remaining frozen contamination caused the lever to not spring back to the normal position.  We advised ATC that we had found a stuck bypass lever and were now ready to taxi.  Ramps and taxiways were poor as [Air Carrier] had an Aircraft X slide off Taxiway F across from the Midfield Freight area.,,,,After pushback ground crew failed to complete proper steps to reengage nose wheel steering.

Aircraft X was 10 miles from Runway 23; approaching the NUMBE intersection on the 295-degree radial from the EMI VORTAC; the authorized feeder-route to the FDK ILS Runway 23 Approach.After receiving such approval; Aircraft Y; requested the same practice ILS Approach and self-announced they were 2 miles from NUMBE; but based on the ADS-B display in Aircraft X; Aircraft Y was approaching the inbound localizer course from the northwest; from which there is no authorized transition or feeder route.Aircraft Y told FDK Tower they would follow behind Aircraft X and slow down but at various points and times between NUMBE; the IAF (10 nm from Runway 23); and Runway 23; Aircraft Y was as close as 500 horizontal feet behind Aircraft X and was proceeding at a higher rate of speed than Aircraft X.Twice during the practice ILS Approach; the ADS-B-based Traffic Alerting System in Aircraft X (the leading aircraft) sounded an aural and visual caution (yellow); meaning Aircraft Y was closing in on the tail of Aircraft X.The flight student in Aircraft X was spooked by these warnings; as well as the radio calls from Aircraft Y saying they were 'too close'; and had difficulty controlling the aircraft and/or experiencing productive learning.Because of this high risk; and the student's unease with the entire situation; Aircraft X aborted the practice ILS 23 Approach and took evasive action (executing the missed approach 1.5-miles from Runway 23 and side-stepping to the left); to get out of the way of the closing aircraft; Aircraft Y.Subsequently; while on the ground; Aircraft Y's Certificated Flight Instructor and co-pilot approached the crew of Aircraft X and laughed at Aircraft X for 'flying too slow.'The crew of Aircraft X felt this was an inappropriate and unsafe display of arrogance; especially in light of Aircraft Y's violation of FAR Section 91.113 (f).,,,,GA flight instructor reported an NMAC during an ILS Runway 23 approach to FDK airport.

The pilot in question didn't realize he did anything bad.I had to pull power to idle; went partially weightless in the seat with the student; and approximately 45+ degrees pitch down in order to avoid the aircraft. I recovered at about 400 feet AGL before climbing back into the traffic pattern.There isn't really a chain of events here; or a complex swiss cheese model; this was a reckless pilot who disregarded scanning for other aircraft and nearly collided with another.I've personally had two ATC directed; and three total (including this one) near misses within 2-3 nm of the field at FDK.,,,,Light aircraft Instructor Pilot reported an NMAC with another aircraft in the traffic pattern at FDK airport.,,

This occurs whether the pilot is calling with an initial check-in or being cleared for an approach. TRACON always issues the BWI altimeter; even though they are provided the ESN weather data (Tower/ASOS). Note that BWI and ESN altimeters rarely are the same. When cleared for an instrument approach to ESN; a pilot should be given the ESN altimeter and not BWI's. As a local pilot; I am keenly aware of the discrepancy in altimeter settings provided by the TRACON; therefore; I ignore the altimeter setting given to me by the TRACON. However; transient pilots may overlook the discrepancy and subsequently descend below minimums on an IAP into ESN. I have talked to Chesapeake Sector supervisors about the problem but haven't been successful in convincing TRACON management that their procedures should be changed.,,,,Designated Pilot Examiner believes pilots should always receive destination airport altimeter setting when checking in to the next TRACON controller instead of receiving a common altimeter setting to maintain separation in that sector.,,
